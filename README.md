#*The Objectives*

1. This project is a part of my coursework requirements for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp. It aims to create an Amazon-like storefront.

1. This will be my second attempt at coding a back-end(or server-side) application.  

1. This homework utilizes Node.js and MySQL to manage data and simulate an online shopping experience.

##*Here's a demo of the app*

## Install and run Bamazon

1. Clone this repo and navigate to the proper folder in the command line.

1. Create a database using MySQL and populate your table with the inventory from bamazon.sql included in this repository.

1. Provide your own password in the bamazonCustomer.js file.

1. Don't forget to install the npm dependencies to your copy before running this.

1. Finally, run the application by typing node bamazonCustomer.js in your cli and just follow the prompts.

## Final Notes

1. In case you're wondering why I chose these products, they are actually ingredients to a dish called Shakshuka. It's a North African/middle eastern dish that can be eaten for brunch, lunch, dinner or midnight snack. The recipe will be here:

(I somehow overlooked the garlic but don't forget to add it)

1. This will be deployed and hopefully, it will have some entertainment value. It will be more to highlight what I've learned so far.

1. Please let me know if you have comments on how to make this app better or if you notice some bugs.

1. I would like to learn how to code better and if there's a better way of doing things, please don't hesitate to show me... and kindly explain to me as if I was a 12 year old :)

1. I am not expecting anybody needing help running this  but just in case, email monmaramba@yahoo.com.
